FORK OF MBZDB : Fix problem when creating Table/Indexes/Pk

1- Edit settings.pl to match your environment.
2- Edit settings_mysql.pl or settings_postgresql.pl to match your database environment.
3- Run ./init.pl

You may need to install the following CPAN modules in order to proceed:
perl -MCPAN -e 'install LWP::UserAgent'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBI'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBD::mysql'

(postgres only)
perl -MCPAN -e 'install DBD::Pg'

===== Version log =====
5.0
  * Full support for NGS for both PostgreSQL and MySQL.
  * settings.pl is now split so that each backend gets its own
    relevant settings file.
  * A few minor bug fixes.
